# Changing Body Temperature and Thermal Perception in VR

## Project Overview
This project, titled **"Changing Body Temperature and Thermal Perception in VR,"** investigates the isolated effects of a virtual heater on the user's hand within a virtual reality (VR) environment. Inspired by the hue-heat hypothesis, the study aims to understand how localized thermal visual cues influence sensory and physiological responses.

## Key Features
- **VR Environment**: Developed using Unity, featuring a realistic virtual room with a chair, table, and a stylized heater.
- **Hand Tracking**: Implemented accurate hand tracking using Meta Quest devices to ensure realistic hand movements.
- **Thermal Perception Simulation**: Created a functional virtual heater with on and off states to simulate the feeling of warmth.
- **Data Collection**: Methods for recording hand positions, skin temperature, and survey responses.

## Experimental Design
The experimental design includes three phases to test the effects of localized heating:
1. Left heater off, right heater on.
2. Left heater on, right heater off.
3. Both heaters off.

## Anticipated Outcomes
- Increased reports of warmth and comfort when the hand is near the virtual heater.
- Contributions to the understanding of thermal perception in VR and the design of immersive experiences.

## Technical Requirements
- **VR Hardware**: Meta Quest devices.
- **Software**: Unity.
- **3D Models**: Stylized 3D model of the heater.
- **Thermal Sensors**: Equipment for monitoring skin temperature.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Unity** and Meta Quest SDK.
2. **Import the project** into Unity.
3. **Connect the Meta Quest device** and thermal sensors.
4. **Configure the project settings** as documented in the configuration files.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Start the VR environment** in Unity.
2. **Wear the Meta Quest device** and ensure hand tracking is enabled.
3. **Interact with the virtual heater** and complete the surveys as prompted.

## Troubleshooting
- **Hand tracking not working**: Ensure the Meta Quest device is properly connected and configured.
- **Thermal sensors not recording**: Check the sensor connections and software integration.

## Future Work
- **Real Participant Testing**: Recruit participants and conduct the study.
- **Data Analysis**: Process and analyze the collected data.
- **Further Investigation**: Explore individual differences in thermal perception, long-term effects, and broader applications.
